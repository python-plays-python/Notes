Compiled languages tend to be more efficient to execute when compared with intrepreted languages.

In compiled language the entire code is compiled each time it is executed,

In interpreted language the program is execute line by line thats why jupyter notebook in python

They use just in time compilation so it is getting faster to execute.

Ex are PHP, Ruby, Python and JavaScript
